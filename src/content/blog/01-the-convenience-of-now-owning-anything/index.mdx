I’ve recently realized something uncomfortable: I don’t really own anything.

I don’t own the movies I watch. I don’t own the music I listen to. I take thousands of photos that live somewhere in the cloud, rarely to be seen again. Everything is available. Nothing is mine.

And I’m starting to think that convenience has quietly cost us something.

This isn’t about money. Streaming is cheaper. Cloud storage is efficient. Access has never been easier. On paper, this looks like progress.

But psychologically, something shifted.

Ownership used to require effort. You saved for an album. You chose it. You listened to it repeatedly because you had to. That repetition shaped your taste. It built memory. It created attachment.

Today, friction is gone. And in its place, algorithms decide what comes next.

That shift became obvious to me during a trip to Japan in November 2024. I had dreamed of going there since I was a kid, growing up in the 90s with a Game Boy in my hands and Pokémon on repeat. When my wife and I finally planned the trip, I wanted to experience it differently.

I decided to bring a film camera.

Not a carefully tested one, either. I bought an untested Nikon F90x for almost nothing. There was a real possibility I would come back with ten days of blank film.

But that risk changed everything.

I brought five rolls of HP5 Plus. That was it. A fixed number of exposures. Every shot had a cost. Every click removed one future possibility. One evening in Tokyo, I stood for nearly thirty mintues in front of a small store in quiet alley. I loved the lighting. I could already see how it would translate to black and white. I waited for someone to pass through the frame, to give the scene the life it needed.

For those two weeks, I barely touched my phone. I paid attention. I waited. I framed scenes carefully because I couldn’t take fifty versions and pick one later. I had to decide in the moment.

The constraint sharpened the experience.

Film photography reintroduced friction: limited shots, delayed feedback, physical negatives. Every frame had weight. I couldn’t hide behind endless retries or fix things later. I had to be there, fully, before pressing the shutter. It made me participate instead of passively record.

And the funny thing is, I’m fairly sure I would have felt the same way even if all five rolls had come back blank. The value wasn’t in the images. It was in the attention. The camera didn’t just capture Japan, it changed how I experienced it.

And that’s when the larger pattern became hard to ignore.

Modern digital systems are built to remove friction. That sounds positive. Less effort, more access, instant results. But they also insert something in between: algorithmic direction.

When you open a music app, you don’t start with silence. You start with suggestions. When you finish a show, the next one begins automatically. When you try to take a photo, filters and enhancements are already waiting.

These systems are optimized for engagement. Engagement is easy to measure. Presence isn't. Maybe that's why one is optimised and the other slowly fades. I notice it in myself. I don't always choose what to watch next. I rarely scroll past the recommendations. I just let it roll.

The goal is not to help you choose more deliberately. It’s to reduce the chance that you stop.

Over time, this changes how we experience culture. If recommendations are based on what keeps us watching, they tend to narrow toward similarity. The safest bet is more of what already worked. That’s efficient for retention. It’s less effective for discovery.

Choice becomes passive. Consumption becomes continuous.

And something subtle erodes: agency.

This is not an argument for going back to the 90s. Part of me misses the slowness. Being bored used to feel uncomfortable, but it forced me to choose. And those choices slowly shaped who I became. But there has been a structural shift. We moved from selecting and owning to accessing and being guided.

For some people, that feels like freedom. Fewer decisions. Less effort.

But there’s a trade-off. When we don’t actively choose, we don’t build the same connection. When nothing requires commitment, nothing demands attention. When everything is available, very little feels earned.

Film photography didn’t make Japan magical. Japan was already magical. The camera simply forced me to slow down enough to notice.

That experience made me question how much of my daily life runs on autopilot. How often I consume without deciding. How rarely I sit with something long enough for it to shape me.

This post is the starting point. I don’t think the solution is to reject technology or romanticize the past. But I do think we need to reintroduce intentional friction in certain parts of our lives.

Because when we don’t own anything - not physically, not mentally, not deliberately - we risk losing more than objects.

We lose involvement.

And I'm not sure yet what the right balance is. But I know I want more of that feeling I had walking through Japan with five rolls in my bag. I was chasing a feeling - the sense of choosing, of being fully there. I didn’t have the words for it then. I’m starting to now.
