It’s now been 10 years since I became a full-time developer. I’ve seen frameworks come and go. I was very lucky to jump on the React bandwagon quite early, and in my free time I grew to love Next.js.

What felt like the new kid on the block that I happily worked on in my spare time is now a multi-billion-dollar company that I include in every slide I present to clients. It’s funny how things develop in life.

Anyway, for this blog, I’ve decided to go with something new. Colleagues and friends have been talking about Astro for a while now, and I’ve always felt too busy to look at something else. To be honest, Next.js has grown into something so big that it’s probably overkill for most basic websites nowadays, so Astro felt like the perfect tool to give this a go.

Let’s see how long this one lasts. Maybe if, for once, technology doesn’t get in the way, I might keep journaling this time.

I’ve always been a big fan of the KISS principle. If something is too complex or has too many options for what it was actually meant to do, you’ll eventually create so much friction that your product will stop being used for its original purpose, even by your most devoted fans.

Ten years in, I've learned that longevity rarely comes from cleverness. It comes from removing just enough friction that you show up again tomorrow. This is me testing that theory.
