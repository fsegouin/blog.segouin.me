An iPod Mini has been sitting on my desk for the last few days.

It’s a small object from an era when your music had edges: limited storage, cables, syncing, a little bit of waiting, and choices you had to live with.

It made me think about how little resistance there is in my day.

Not in a dramatic way. Mostly in small, ordinary ways. The kind you don’t notice until you do.

Most mornings I make coffee with a pod machine. One button, done. It’s fine.

But recently I started setting aside time for a V60 pourover instead. Boiling the water, grinding the beans, watching the bloom. It takes fifteen minutes I didn’t think I had. And every time, the coffee tastes better than the pod - not just because of the method, but because I was there for it.

I put on Spotify and let it decide what comes next. Most of the time it does a good job, good enough that I don’t intervene.

YouTube plays in the background while I work, sliding from one video to the next with barely a pause long enough for me to ask if I actually want to keep watching.

And then there’s the part that’s closer to my identity.

I open a terminal, type `claude`, and a second later I’m moving again.

I’m conflicted, because I actually love how good these tools are. They’re impressive and genuinely useful, and they lower the barrier in a way that still feels slightly unreal.

In the last few weeks I built two small apps from nothing in a handful of days. Things I wanted for myself. No roadmap. No meeting cadence. Just an idea, a tight feedback loop, and a lot of “try again”.

In the moment it felt great in a very direct way: I had a thought, I tested it, something real appeared on my screen.

But it also made me notice something I didn’t expect: how quickly “I shipped” can turn into “okay, what now?”

I think part of it is that the whole stack used to push back more, not just software.

Hardware limits, storage, battery, bandwidth. You felt the constraints, and they shaped what you tried in the first place.

Not always in a good way. A lot of that friction was pointless. But some of it was formative, because you had to sit with a problem for long enough to change how you approached it.

When I started my career, I joined a small agency called Siberia. The London studio was still young. I didn’t know anything about “shipping” as a concept, or what good client work looked like.

I remember spending days on a single interaction. We were building an app where you’d snap a picture of your sneakers and they’d appear in a virtual wardrobe: model name, colorway, everything pulled in automatically. Image recognition was still early, and I wanted the moment of capture to feel magical.

So I sat with the animations. The way the shoe landed on screen, the timing of the label fading in. None of it was strictly necessary, but the slowness of crafting each transition let you feel every decision. You noticed what worked and what didn’t, because you had to build each piece by hand.

Tech was part of it, but it wasn’t the point. The point was the thing we were trying to make real, and the constraints forced you to care about the whole shape of it.

Over time the work changed. Bigger teams, more layers, less making and more coordinating. I spent more time in documents than in code. That’s fine. That’s often how a career evolves.

But now, with agents, I can feel another shift.

Coding starts to look less like the craft and more like a lever. Something you pull to move ideas forward faster. In theory, that should free you up for the parts that matter most: taste, decisions, trade-offs, clarity.

And yet I keep coming back to a quieter question.

When everything is one click away, when every feature is one prompt away, what’s left for us to earn?

Not “earn” as in deserve. More like: what’s left that asks something from us. Something that makes us choose, commit, and live with the consequences of the choice.

I have a memory from when I was a kid, messing around with cheat codes.

Sometimes I’d skip the hard part of a game, or trigger the ending without playing much of it. It felt like seeing something I wasn’t supposed to see, like slipping backstage. A quick rush, and then it evaporated.

I barely remember the games I finished that way. And today, coding with these tools brings me the same weird feeling of having achieved something without really taking anything home from it.

I do remember the ones that asked me to stay. The ones that made me try again. The ones that built patience and attention without me realizing it.

I’m not trying to make life harder for its own sake. I’m just noticing what disappears when nothing asks me to slow down.

But I’m starting to wonder if a life that never pushes back slowly trains you to stop pushing, too.

So lately I’ve been experimenting with small, deliberate constraints. Nothing heroic.

The iPod is one of them.

Choosing an album instead of a playlist.

Turning autoplay off.

Writing down what I’m building (and why) before I open the terminal, so the tool doesn’t decide the direction for me.

I don’t know where this leads. I’m not even sure “friction” is the right word.

I just know that when everything gets smoother, I miss the moments that make me feel involved.

And I’m trying to notice what brings those moments back.
